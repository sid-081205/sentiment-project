i wanna judge sentiments and find their influence on some factor - im thinking how twitter or reddit or
news sentiments affect crypto prices but i dont think there's a big correlation at the moment 
(based on the few research papers i read online)

i think i'll weigh sentiments according to likes/upvotes/some other metric
and then judge sentiments. the only issue is creating this weighing - i think lets do twitter.

my friend gave me an interesting perspective - HYPE. for short term fluctuations, he says the
sentiment holds much less importance and the hype drives short term behavior

ok im not that fond of doing cypto anymore - it's too variable and fluctuates based on too many factors.
also read a bunch of research papers which don't help the case. so what do i do know?

ok oil prices might be interesting and how they relate to news sentiment

OK NO THE YFINANCE API IS CRAZY IT HAS SO MUCH DATA

21/4/2025

ok the yfinance thing is working but i'm having trouble in saving all the date and news articles in a discoinatry.
pythong does not alow sof rduplicates in keys of a dicionary so i'm thinking of putting all the news articles of one date in one key value

that worked out - make the sentiment thing too and put that all in one database, this was quick.

not sure about what to do with the missing sentiment values and concentration of data now

22/4/2025

so i don't think averaging out the senitment values to
find a sentimetn value for each month is the way

i don't see any correlation with average monthly sentiemtns and oil prices
probably expected beause all the positive news just compensates for the negative news

need a different way for judging sentiment - vader might not be the way
